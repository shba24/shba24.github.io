*Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.*

Welcome to my technical blog!

I'm a *Senior Software Engineer* at **Amazon AWS**, where I work on the Lake Formation team. With a background in **Cloud Storage**, **Data Analytics**, **Distributed Systems**, **Security**, and **Database Internals**. Before AWS, I worked at Microsoft Azure Storage and Rubrik Storage teams.

I love exploring data and scale, always looking for efficient solutions to complex problems. Based in **Seattle, WA**, I share my home with a playful French bulldog.

Through this blog, I aim to share insights, experiences, and the latest developments in the **Big Data** and **Database World**. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a tech enthusiast, or someone curious about the world of cloud computing and data analytics, I hope you find my posts informative and engaging.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
